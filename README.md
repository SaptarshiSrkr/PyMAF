PyMAF will be a lightweight, research-oriented codebase for density estimation using normalizing flows, with a focus on [Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07057).

This project grew out of discussions during the Puneâ€“Mumbai Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics Meeting ([PMCAP](https://pmcap-iiser.github.io/Website/)) at IISER Pune in September 2025, where we identified the need for an accessible framework to experiment with normalizing flows.
